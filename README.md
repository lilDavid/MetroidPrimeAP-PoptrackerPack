## Autotracking

### Archipelago

This pack fully supports autotracking for items, locations, and options if you connect to an AP server.
Note that door colors are not automatically tracked to avoid spoilers.

### UAT

If you decide to play Randovania, or some other form of Metroid Prime randomizer, you can autotrack using UAT instead
by using the [GameCube UAT Bridge](https://github.com/lilDavid/GameCube-UAT-Bridge) program. With it, this pack can
autotrack for either Dolphin or a real Wii or Wii U using Nintendont. The script to use for that is at

## Credits

The AP world for Metroid Prime is currently in development by Electro1512 and Hesto2, based on
randomprime, originally written by April Wade and maintained by the Randovania contributors.
